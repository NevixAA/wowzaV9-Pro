A rising hit rate with a positive gap is the model being too cautious about the starters it tips, not the model improving. Fixes under test: log-odds calibration (v9 PR calibration-logit-shadow) and Player V3's expected-minutes model. Props stay paper: priced tips still hit below the bookmaker's implied probability.
